==================================
Copyright (c) 2017: Paulito Palmes.

### Overview

This is a simple implementation of Direct Feedback Alignment (DFA) to solve the XOR problem using Julia with parallelism. The code also includes the Backpropagation algorithm together with Feedback Alignment (FA) and Indirect Feedback Alignment (IFA) based on the paper of [Arild NÃ¸kland] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01596).
